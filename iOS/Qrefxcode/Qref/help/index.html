                <dd>
                    <p>No problem. Qref checklists are but a tap away. Purchase and download the checklist you need
                        directly from the app. Tap Download to view a list of available aircraft models. This list is
                        being added to regularly, so check back if you don't see the checklist you need.</p>

                <dd>
                    <p>Sometimes, if an in-app purchase doesn't go through for some reason, simply download the
                        checklist again. Both we and Apple keep track of your purchases. If you weren't charged for it
                        the first time, you will be prompted to buy it. If you were charged, you'll be able to download
                        it again at no additional cost. This is also the case if you remove your checklist from the
                        dashboard.</p>

                    <p>Setting up a Qref account allows for automatic backup of your changes and allows syncing across
                        devices.</p>

                    <p>Please note that your Qref Checklist app account is separate from any other account, including a
                        qref.com account. At this time, you can only access your checklists from an app.</p>

                        turn on edit mode. Tap on the desired aircraft and you will be prompted for the tail number.</p>

                    <p>The tail number will be synced with your account the next time you log in or select Manual Sync
                        from the menu. This means you'll see the tail number (and any checklist edits) on any device you
                        log in with using the Qref app.</p>

                        add this checklist back, you can by simply downloading it again. You will not be charged for it
                        again. Promise! <b>One thing to keep in mind, though... your edits will be gone if you remove

                        checklist from the Dashboard (see above), go to Downloads, and download the checklist again.
                        Because we keep track of your purchases, you won't be charged for it again.</b></p>

            <h2>Syncing</h2>
            <dl>
                <dt><i class="icon icon-caret-right"></i> Syncing between two or more devices</dt>
                <dd>
                    <p>Syncing your edited checklists between multiple devices is easy. Your Qref account links your app
                        to a cloud server that
                        maintains a backup of all of your checklists, including any edits.</p>

                    <p>Syncing can be done 2 ways.
                    <ol>
                        <li><b>Immediately after editing:</b> When you are done editing on the first device, tap the
                            pencil icon at the top of the page <i class="icon icon-pencil"></i> to turn off edit mode.
                            Tap "Sync to Server" to send the changes you made to the Qref cloud server. There, they will
                            be available for another device to sync to.
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Manually:</b> At any time, you can manually sync your checklists and any edits made to
                            the cloud server. To do this, tap the menu icon <i class="icon icon-th-list"></i>, then tap
                            "Manual Sync" <i class="icon icon-cloud-download"></i>. If the checklist on your device is
                            newer than on the server, it is sent to the server. Otherwise, if the checklist on the
                            server is newer than your local version, the local version is replaced with server version.
                        </li>
                    </p>
                    </ol>
                    </p>
                    <p>Once the changes are sync'd, you can update any other devices by performing a manual sync as
                        described above. The newer checklist on the server will replace the older checklist on your
                        other devices.</p>

                    <p><b>Note: in order to sync across multiple devices, all devices must be signed in to the same
                        account.</b></p>
                </dd>
            </dl>
            <h2>Multiple, Duplicate Checklists</h2>
            <dl>
                <dt><i class="icon icon-caret-right"></i> Can I dupliacte a checklist?</dt>
                <dd>
                    <p>Yes, and easily so. If you would like two different versions of the same checklist, simply
                        download the checklist again. Once you have purchased a checklist, you will not be charged for
                        another download. Tap "Download" <i class="icon icon-download"></i> at the bottom of the
                        Dashboard and find the model you've already purchased. Tap on it, and then tap "Install". This
                        will install another version of the checklist which you can access from the Dashboard. A new,
                        random tail number will be assigned so you can tell the two apart. </p>

                    <p><b>Note: The new, second checklist will contain the default checklist data and will not include
                        any edits made to the first version.</b></p>
                </dd>
